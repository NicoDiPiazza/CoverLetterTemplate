# CoverLetterTemplate
Run this script in your terminal, and after a few questions, it'll fill in a template for a cover letter so that you don't have to go through the tedium of writing a cover letter

I would like to eventually add a user memory file, so that you don't have to input your info like your name and contact info every time, but that will be a later project if I ever do it.
